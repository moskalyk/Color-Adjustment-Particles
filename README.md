# Color Adjustment Particles (maybe onionized)
tune into your body core. imagining color-charged energetic points in lock-step with a group.

the more folks play, the higher liklihood particles are obfuscated on the internet with throttle prevention (hypothesis), while also creating technospiritual unity with earth, or even moon roundtrips packet loops

peeling back the body psyche like an onion, with layers to attain enlightenment of the inner core

Q: adapt the solution to accomodate onion particles, so particles sent to bodies are networked and privacy-focused, harmonizing with ttl-randomized amongst the peer network & obfuscated

## Output (with color)

## TODO
- ya _more_ private & harmonizing: running test.js onion indicates one can build an onion packet solution from `bitcore-lib`
- unit: Rasberry Pi adapted interface to run terminal for on-desk HUD
- velocity: need help making the ⚫ tree just grey, with ❍ color & better timing

## Underlying tech for advancements in application
- all or nothing network blockage versus individual particle getting lost
- smart home, jailbreak [networked massage](https://www.target.com/p/belmint-full-body-vibrating-massage-mat-with-heat-5-massage-modes-3-intensity-levels-beige/-/A-84240457#lnk=sametab) or private sex devices
